31. Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
32. Find the kth smallest element in a given array.
33. Find if two binary search trees are same. Their roots can be taken as arguments.
34. Convert a sorted array into binary search tree.
35. Given an integer array and an integer k , find the contigious subarray of size k with the highest sum.
36. determine , given a head of a linked list , if it is has a cycle.
37. There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
    Each child must have at least one candy and Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
38. Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:
    If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
    If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
    Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.
39. The following is the definition of Sum-Product of digits of a float : the numbers at 'i'th place after the decimal point should be multiplied with
    number at the 'i'th place before decimal point. i.e. 1/10th place should be multiplied with 10s place and 1/100th place should be multiplied with 100s place... . Write an efficient algorithm to calculate the Sum-Product of digits of input float number.
